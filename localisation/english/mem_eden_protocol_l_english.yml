 origin_mem_eden_protocol_desc:0 "The Environmental Diversity Expansion Network Protocol was initiated by the inhabitants of a doomed world without the means to save their own civilization. Without FTL-technology or the industrial base to move a significant portion of their population into space habitats, they did what was within their power and created a small station housing a database of their entire biosphere's DNA. An AI was put in place to saveguard and expand the facility in order to eventually seed new life on far planets."
